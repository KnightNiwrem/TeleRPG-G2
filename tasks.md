# MMORPG on Telegram - Implementation Plan

**Developer's Note:** Throughout this project, maintain a `copilot-notes.md` file. Use it to log ideas, approaches you've tried (especially those that didn't work), and any architectural decisions. This will save time and prevent revisiting dead ends. Remember to follow a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach for all feature code: write function stubs, then tests, then implement the logic.
